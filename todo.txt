Today:



Updates to framework:
	
	ability to resize window and a OnResize function

	camera look system

TODO:
	Handling for multiple 
	primitives in 
	sponza scene

	Blinn-Phong lighting model

	SSAO

Multiple primitive handling:
	I need to move all resources
	into mesh loop

	I dont need to preserve the data
	just the named buffer storage

	so mesh should maintain an
	array of Vertex Array Objects
	then to draw I will iterate
	over the list of VAOs, bind them
	and call draw
